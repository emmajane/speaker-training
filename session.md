# Agenda

- Popular presentation formats.
- Pitching your presentation.

# Presentation Formats

Note: Not all presentations are an hour in length; and not all presentations need to be a sage on a stage. Learn about Ignite talks, fireside chats, and the traditional conference session.

- Ignite / PechaKucha
- Moderated Panel
- Interview / Fireside Chat
- TED(x)
- Product or Code Demo
- Sales Pitch
- Facilitated Discussion / BoF


## Longer Formats

- Conference Session
- Webinar
- Conference Keynote

## Presentation Formats

There's more than one way to do it. Choose a format that suits your needs.

# Pitching Your Presentation

Note: There's a knack to creating a tempting session description, and it's not just what you write, but matching your ideas to what conference organisers are looking to curate. Learn how to review proposals and past conferences to find just the right topic; then learn how to craft your winning proposal.


## A good pitch satisfies<br />multiple target audiences.


### Satisfy Conference Organisers

be sufficiently different from other proposals to fit the talk into the schedule


### Convince Bosses and Ticket Payers

have a clear outcome which justifies the cost of the conference ticket


### Attract Attendees

entertaining enough to generate a buzz and lure in a crowd


## Pitch the Problem

Note: The first thing your abstract needs to do is explain the problem your session will solve. Your abstract should, in gory detail, make people uncomfortable with how horrible things are right now. Even if you are describing a new language, there is a reason that new software exists. Unpack that reason.


## List Learning Outcomes


### Learning Outcomes == Test Driven Development 

(sort of)

Note: Learning outcomes are a tool used by curriculum developers to establish the definition of done for their lessons. Your learning outcome must answer the question "what can an attendee DO as a result of this session?" ... and they must be able to prove that skill. If it's not a testable outcome, it's not a learning outcome.


### Sample Learning Outcome

By the end of this session, attendees will be able to:

use Bloom's Taxonomy

to create testable learning outcomes for their conference sessions.


### Working Backwards from My Outcome...

- My presentation must include an overview of Bloom's Taxonomy.
- I need to provide examples of good, and bad learning outcomes.
- I should test my audience to ensure they have achieved the desired outcome.


## Sort Of

We're actually doing cheater learning outcomes because I'm not specifying the accuracy or the precision of the outcome when tested.


## Bloom's Taxonomy

## It's Not Always the Same

## And It's Been Updated

## There Are Also Made-Up Facts<br />About Bloom's Taxonomy

## Example of a Bad Learning Outcome

By the end of this session, attendees will know Bloom's Taxonomy.

Note: Impossible to test. Unclear what the outcome actually is.


## Can You Fix The Example Below?

By the end of this session, attendees will know Bloom's Taxonomy.

- Describe a problem.
- Outline the outcomes.

#  Preparing for Stage Success

Note: So you've won a coveted spot at a conference. Congratulations! Learn a routine that will break down the preparation work into a manageable schedule that will take you from proposal acceptance through to the end of your presentation on game day.

- Start with the audience in mind. Have empathy, and aim for outcomes.
- Leave yourself enough time to refine your thinking about the topic.
- Do more writing and brainstorming before you start your slides.
- Get feedback early in the process so that you can address common misconceptions / misunderstandings in your presentation.
- Leading into the conference itself: you're going to be nervous. Embrace this and control what you can control.
- The stage is yours. Get to know it, befriend it, and then own it.

## Brainstorming Phase

- Write down the learning outcomes for the session.
- Choose the format for the presentation which best matches my desired learning outcomes.
- Write a table of contents / agenda for the topic with the key ideas I want to convey.
- Write the session description based on work to date. Ready to propose the topic to a meetup or event.
- Write a blog post; or series of blog posts about your talk.


## Draft Phase

- Write the first draft of your slides, incorporating comments from the blog posts you've written.


## Polish Phase

- Start saying your talk outloud.
- Fix the slides to match your story, adding imagery where relevant.
- Decrease the amount of text on each slide.
- Add resources / reference links.


### Accessibility Checklist

- Colours: colour blindness, contrast.
- Size: Ensure all text is no smaller than 1/10 the height of the slide.
- Motion: Remove unnecessary animations.
- Humour: We are an international conference with a code of conduct. Give respect.


## Practice Phase

- Screen cast your practice sessions.
- Record any "live" demos.
- Double check the session description.
- Pack your day bag for your presentation and make sure everything fits!


## Pre-Conference Phase

- Do one more full run of your presentation.
- Remind your supporters of the time / room for your presentation.
- Simplify your speaker notes.
- Optional: print your speaker notes for easy review.
- Get a good night's sleep.


## Final Prepations

(This assumes a multi-day conference. Your time line may vary.)


### Day Before

- Go to the room where you'll be presenting.
- Introduce yourself to the AV team if they are around.
- If possible, do a tech check in your room.
- Make sure the room # is the same on all versions of the schedule.
- Drink lots of water and make sure you are hydrated.
- Upload your slides.
- If you're an introvert, get as much quiet time as you can during the day to ensure you're fully charged for tomorrow.


### Night Before

Pack your bag for tomorrow and include:

- Fully charged laptop.
- Power cable for your laptop + power adapter if you are not in your home country.
- Presentation on USB as PDF in case your laptop dies.
- Printed speaker notes.
- Water bottle (filled).
- VGA display converter thingy (for the projector).
- Remote control (if you have one).
- Clean shirt and trousers (for those of us who are prone to spilling coffee down our fronts)


### You probably won't sleep tonight.<br/>Don't stress about that.<br />Do the best you can to relax.


### Morning Of

- Try to eat breakfast. Being stressed out takes calories.
- Hydrate with water, or fruit juice. A dry throat goes hoarse quickly.
- Check in with the conference organisers so they know you are on-site and ready to present.
- Smile lots. It may trick your body into thinking this is fun.


### Half an Hour Before

- Final pee!
- If the presentation ahead of you is still going, either wait outside the room, or sneak into the back quietly.


### (Literally) The Last Few Minutes

- As soon as you can, get onto the stage.
- Get your laptop plugged in and working with the projector.
- Get help putting your mic on if it's a clip mic.
- Navigate to your first slide, and start the presentation.
- More smiling!


## During the Presentation

Let people know at the beginning of the presentation when you would like to field their questions.

- At the end of the presentation. Best for new speakers.
- During the presentation at specific points. Great if you're running fast.
- During the presentation at any time. Caution: don't get derailed!
